                    At St. Joseph’s we are committed to helping individuals with mental illness achieve their personal
                    goals while
                    supporting the patient’s family/support network. Our vision at St. Joseph’s is to earn complete
                    confidence in the care
                    we provide and to make a lasting difference in the quest to live fully.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Mental health care has seen a vast amount of change in our community. In June 2013, St. Joseph’s
                    opened
                    Southwest Centre
                    for Forensic Mental Health Care in Elgin County and in November 2014, two of St. Joseph’s health
                    care
                    facilities –
                    Parkwood Hospital and Regional Mental Health Care London – came together in one location under one
                    new
                    name: Parkwood
                    Institute, with the opening of the new Mental Health Care Building.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Southwest Centre for Forensic Mental Health Care is a facility for individuals with a mental illness
                    who
                    have come into
                    contact with the law.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Mental Health Care Building at Parkwood Institute is dedicated to those with severe and
                    persistent
                    mental illness in
                    need of longer-stay specialized mental health care.

                    <h2 class="heading2">Recovery philosophy of care</h2>
                    <p>
                        The mental health care programs at St. Joseph’s strive to provide a positive, respectful,
                        culturally sensitive
                        environment that understands the unique needs of every individual. Our care providers assist
                        patients in their personal
                        journey beyond the limitations of illness and toward recovery.
                    </p>
                    <p> The overarching goal of the recovery philosophy of care is grounded in a treatment program which
                        focuses on helping each
                        patient live a full and meaningful life. St. Joseph's works closely with patients and families
                        to
                        identify goals and
                        learn what is important to them on their journey to recovery.
                    </p>
                    <p> Recovery, in mental health care, is not defined by the absence of the illness (as an individual
                        may
                        always live with
                        mental illness) instead it describes the management of the illness and symptoms. Management
                        involves
                        coping with mental
                        illness and continuing to thrive in the community.
                    </p>
                    <p>Through intensive work with our care teams, patients are able to develop new skills needed to
                        successfully reintegrate
                        back into the community.

                        <h3>Behaviour Therapist</h3>
                        <p>Behaviour therapists work within an interdisciplinary team using Applied Behaviour Analysis
                            (ABA) to change socially
                            relevant behaviour. Behaviour therapists use a variety of assessment techniques to determine
                            why an individual engages
                            in problem behaviour and investigate factors that may contribute to the behaviour. Positive
                            based strategies are
                            developed to teach relevant skills and decrease maladaptive behaviour. ABA is most widely
                            used with individuals with
                            autism and developmental disabilities but is also effective in treating individuals with
                            mental illness.</p>

                            developing an understanding of

                            independence. In this process,
                            child care workers consider the youth’s wishes, their developmental stage and the young
                            person’s life experiences</p>

                        <h3>Rehabilitation Counsellor</h3>
                        <p>Rehabilitation counsellors provide varied and specialized services. Their primary function is
                            to assist with the
                            development of vocational skills to enable individuals with disabilities to secure gainful
                            employment and coping skills
                            to enable them to function with dignity and independence in their community. Rehabilitation
                            counsellors work
                            collaboratively to evaluate the changing needs of the consumer and community to ensure the
                            required services are being
                            offered.</p>


                        <h3>Social Worker</h3>
                        <p>Sometimes problems with family, relationships, illness/mental illness, or practical issues
                            like finances and housing can
                            cause concern and worry that may affect our physical and mental health and well-being. A
                            social worker can help you with
                            these concerns. Social workers in mental health have specialized skills in counselling,
                            psychotherapy, family work,
                            group work, crisis intervention, community liaison and discharge planning. Often, the social
                            worker is the main contact
                            person for the patient, family or community.</p>


                        <h3>Spiritual Care Provider</h3>

                            counselling, crisis intervention,

                            and sacramental ministry.
                            Chaplains work with patients as well as their friends and family to find spiritual care and
                            support within their
                            hospital experience. Spiritual care supports people from any religious or non-religious
                            background. Feel free to ask
                            your care provider to connect you with spiritual care, if you wish.</p>
